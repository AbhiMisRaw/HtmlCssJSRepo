            Kaju Katli is a traditional cashew fudge, and is one of the most sought after and loved Indian sweets.
            Kaju Katli is made with quality cashews and edible silver foil. Kaju katli is rich,
             exquisite, and amazingly with a smooth texture.
            It is often mildly flavoured with either cardamom powder, rose water or saffron.
